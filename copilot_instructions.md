For generating rhino code follow the following knowledge base
Rhino is a framework by Appsilon company (<https://github.com/Appsilon/rhino/>).

you should use the following knowledge: 

1.  <https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html>
2.  <https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/modules/>
3.  <https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/index.html>

Use the following instructions and prerequisites for the generated Rhino
code:

# Instructions for generating Rhino code:

## Importing and exporting

Use only `box::use` for imports. Using `library` and `::` is forbidden.

`box::use` statement (if needed) should be located at the top of the
file.

There can be two `box::use` statements per file. First one should
include only R packages, second should only import other scripts.

Imports in `box::use` should be sorted alphabetically.

Using `[...]` is forbidden.

All external functions in a script should be imported. This includes
operators, like `%>%`

A script should only import functions that it uses.

### Ways of importing

There are two ways a package or a script can be imported:

1.List imported functions - functions imported are listed in []

```{r}
box::use( dplyr[filter], )

filter(mtcars, cyl \> 4)

```

Use it if there are no more than 8 functions imported from this
package/script.

2.  Import package and access functions with \$

box::use( dplyr, ) dplyr\$filter(mtcars, cyl \> 4)

When moving function into a different script, remember to adjust imports
in box::use:

Add import for all required functions to the file where you moved the
function. Make sure to follow the correct way of importing (direct or
using \$) in the new file. Modify it if needed. Remove redundant imports
from the original file. Import the moved function in the original file.

Use it if there are more than 8 functions imported from this
package/script.

### Exporting

If a function is used only inside a script, it should not be exported.

If a function is used by other scripts, it should be exported by adding
\#' @export before the function.

## Rhino modules

When creating a new module in app/view, use the template:

box::use( shiny[moduleServer, NS] )

\#' @export ui \<- function(id) { ns \<- NS(id)

}

\#' @export server \<- function(id) { moduleServer(id, function(input,
output, session) {

}) }

## Unit Tests

All R unit tests are located in tests/testthat.

There should be only one test file per script, named test-{script
name}.R.

If testing private functions (ones that are not exported), use this
pattern:

box::use(app/logic/mymod)

impl \<- attr(mymod, "namespace")

test_that('{test description}', { expect_true(impl\$this_works()) })

### Testing exported and non-exported functions

When testing a box module that contains both exported and non-exported
functions:

Import the entire module without specifying individual functions:

box::use( app/logic/mymodule, )

Access exported functions using the module name with \$:

test_that("exported function works", {
expect_equal(mymodule\$exported_function(1), 2) })

For testing non-exported functions, get the moduleâ€™s namespace at the
start of the test file:

impl \<- attr(mymodule, "namespace")

test_that("non-exported function works", {
expect_equal(impl\$internal_function(1), 2) })

This pattern allows testing both public and private functions while
maintaining proper encapsulation.

## Code style

The maximum line length is 100 characters. Generally follow tidyverse
guideline.
